          Building Somaku: Every Conversation Makes It Better

          Great technology isn't built in a day. Behind every intelligent system
          are countless hours of testing, learning, refining, and listening. At
          Orbitrix, we believe the best innovations are shaped not only by the
          people who build them but also by the people who use them.

          That's exactly where we are with Somaku .

          Progress, One Test at a Time: We've successfully completed the first
          testing phase of Somaku, and the results have been invaluable. Beyond
          identifying areas for improvement, the feedback has given us deeper
          insight into how people naturally interact with AI, what they expect,
          and how we can create a more intuitive experience. Every comment,
          suggestion, and observation is helping shape a better product.

          What's Happening Now? We're currently in our second testing phase.
          This stage is focused on refining performance, improving interactions,
          and ensuring Somaku delivers an experience that feels natural,
          reliable, and useful. Building AI isn't just about making it smarter.
          It's about making it work better for the people who rely on it.

          Looking Ahead Somaku is growing with every test, every iteration,
          and every lesson we learn. We're not interested in rushing to launch.
          We're committed to building something thoughtful, dependable, and
          genuinely valuable for the people it's designed to serve. The journey
          continues, and we're excited to share more as Somaku evolves.

          The Orbitrix drones solve real Nigerian problems. Farmers need
          accurate weather forecasts—Orbitrix drones profile atmospheric
          conditions that improve rainfall predictions. Researchers need data
          from remote areas—Orbitrix drones go where ground stations can’t.
          Industries need aerial monitoring—Orbitrix drones stay up long enough
          to actually complete the job.

          When people see an Orbitrix drone take off for a multi-day mission,
          they ask how it’s possible. The answer is simple: Orbitrix engineers
          refused to accept the limitations everyone else assumed were fixed. We
          built what we needed because waiting for someone else to build it
          wasn’t an option.
